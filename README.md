GENDER RECOGNITION BY VOICE.

Short Description
Gender Recognition by Voice is a machine-learning model that takes voice samples as input and classifies them as male or female based on their audio features. 


Does this solve a real-world problem?
Yes!
Problem:
AI voice assistants and automated customer service systems often struggle to personalize interactions based on the user’s identity.
Solution:
This can help tailor responses, adjust tone, or offer gender-specific recommendations in virtual assistants and customer service bots.
